<br>College life is something that i feel is still currently new to me.
<br>Right now I'm in my second year as a Data Science student but if im being honest,
<br>if my moms friend didnt help me, i maybe would still be in my first year as i would fail to enroll.
<br>But things turned out to be pretty good and right now i got good friends that wants to improve and learn me
<br>Right now i'm improving in a way that is average but i am happy with my current situation. :)
