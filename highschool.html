<br>Ah yes, of course, highschool life...
<br>I personally feel that highschool life my highschool life is the most memorable part of my life
<br>because here i met a lot of people who are now potentially my lifelong friends
<br>you see that i only said "friends" right? Well it's because here i met my first girlfriend
<br>sadly though, our relationship only lasted 1 year and 3 months even though we promised each other to be together forever
<br>that was a wake up call for me that not everything goes as planned. :')
