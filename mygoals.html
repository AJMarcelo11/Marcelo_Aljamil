<br>My goals huh...
<br>I don't have much goals that i want to achieve personally
<br>but one thing's for sure though, I want to graduate college and then find a decent paying job
<br>and after that, i'll just try to find more goals that i want because right now
<br>I just feel empty, and unmotivated to do anything other than wanting to live in peace with no problems.
